# Super-Mario-Game

Super Mario is a platform game series created by Nintendo starring their mascot, Mario. It is the central series of the greater Mario franchise. At least one Super Mario game has been released for every major Nintendo video game console. However, there have also been a number of Super Mario video games released on non-Nintendo gaming platforms. There are more than 20 games in the series.

# Introduction
This project is a simple arcade-style game where the player controls Mario to get a better score. The game is built using an LED matrix for display, a joystick for control, while an LCD screen displays the main character. This project aims to learn and deepen information about embedded programming. I chose this game because I made a connection with the past when I was 10 years old and played Super Mario. Back then, I played this game thinking it was the coolest game, and now it's time to make it myself. For me, this project represents progression and a way to accumulate new information.

# General Description
The game begins when the player presses the fire button, initiating a countdown sequence ("3... 2... 1..."). Once the countdown ends, Mario appears and you control him. The player uses the joystick to control the main character to make a better score and to avoid obstacles.During the game, the score is counted by time, where I said that the time should be the score until Mario hits the obstacles and the game is lost. The game ends when Mario hits an obstacle.
After the game ends, the score appears on the display and restart game.

#### For this project, I will use various features from previous lab exercises:
- The interrupts and timers in Lab 2 will be used for precise timing of events, such as the movement of the main character Mario.
- The button manipulation in Lab 0 will handle the press of the trigger button and the joystick.
- The AnalogWrite and AnalogRead in Lab 3 will be used for joystick control.
